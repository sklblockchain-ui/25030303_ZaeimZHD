### Target Selection

For this exercise, the loopback IP address `127.0.0.1` (localhost) was used as the scanning target. This ensures that all reconnaissance activities were conducted within a controlled and authorized lab environment without targeting external or third-party systems.## Conclusion for Nmap

Nmap is a powerful reconnaissance tool that allows penetration testers to identify open ports, detect service versions, and determine operating system information. It provides critical intelligence that supports further exploitation phases in penetration testing.
